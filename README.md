# Paytm‑end‑to‑end

A full‑stack implementation of a payment-wallet‑style web application, inspired by Paytm.  
The project includes both frontend (user UI) and backend (API + database) — enabling user registration, authentication, balance management, and payment/transfer flows.

## 📝 Overview

This project aims to simulate a digital wallet / payment system similar to Paytm — letting users:

- Sign up / log in  
- View their current balance  
- Send money to other users  
- View transaction history / status  

It is a learning & demonstration project to show end-to-end integration: frontend UI, backend API, database transactions, and secure authentication.

---

## ✅ Features

- User Authentication (Signup / Login)  
- Secure Money Transfer between users  
- Balance update / management  
- Basic UI for wallet dashboard & transaction pages  
- RESTful API backend  
- Proper separation between client (frontend) and server (backend)  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js (or your chosen frontend framework), with HTML/CSS/JS  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js (or similar) for API server  
- **Database:** MongoDB (or any other, depending on your implementation)  
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Token) or session-based auth  
- **HTTP client:** Axios / Fetch (frontend ↔ backend communication)  
- **Others:** Any additional libraries you have used (state management, validation, styles etc.)

> ⚠️ Adjust the exact frameworks/libraries based on what’s in your `frontend/` and `backend/` directories.

## 🔧 Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or above)  
- npm or yarn  
- MongoDB running locally or access to a MongoDB Atlas / remote MongoDB server  

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install           # or yarn install
# create a .env file based on .env.example (if exists)
npm run dev           # or `node index.js` depending on your setup
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install           # or yarn install
npm run dev           # or `npm start` depending on your setup
```

Once both are running, open your browser and navigate to your frontend local URL (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`) to access the app.

---

## 🎯 Usage

1. Signup or login as a user.  
2. View your wallet balance and transaction history.  
3. Transfer money to another user by providing their credentials.  
4. Observe backend API calls and balance updates—demonstrating full‑stack transaction flow.

## 🔐 Environment Variables

In the backend (and frontend if any):

| Variable        | Description                           |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|
| `MONGODB_URI`   | MongoDB connection string / URI       |
| `JWT_SECRET`    | Secret key used for JWT authentication |
| *(other vars)*  | e.g. port number, API keys, etc.      |

> Make sure to never commit real secrets to the repository.

## 🚧 Future Improvements / TODO

- Add transaction history with timestamps  
- Add password reset / user profile management  
- Add input validations & error handling  
- Improve UI / responsiveness  
- Add tests (unit / integration)  
- Add deployment configuration (e.g. Docker, CI/CD)
